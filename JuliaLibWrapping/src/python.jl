Output configuration for a Python ctypes-based wrapper package. `dir` is the
directory into which the package will be written; a sub-directory named
`package_name` is created and is the importable Python module. `library_basename`
is the shared library's basename without an OS-specific suffix (e.g. `"libsimple"`,
which will be loaded from `libsimple.so` / `libsimple.dylib` / `libsimple.dll`
depending on the host).

When `bundle_subdir` is a string (e.g. `"bundle"`), the emitter assumes the
shared library and its juliac runtime closure (`libjulia`, sysimage, stdlibs,
artifacts) will be laid out under that subdirectory of the Python package in
the standard `--bundle` shape (`<bundle_subdir>/lib/<lib>`,
`<bundle_subdir>/lib/julia/`, `<bundle_subdir>/artifacts/`). The generated
loader looks for the library inside the bundle first, the generated
`pyproject.toml` widens `package-data` to include the bundle tree, and
[`build_library`](@ref) with `bundle = true` will copy the bundle there.
The default `nothing` preserves the flat single-`.so`-next-to-the-package
layout and is the right choice for callers placing the library by hand.

`version` sets the `version` field in the generated `pyproject.toml`. It must
be PEP 440-compatible; a Julia `Major.Minor.Patch` version string is valid.

`privatized` records whether the bundle carries a salted `libjulia`. A package
without one warns if another wrapped package is already loaded. [`build_library`](@ref)
sets this option; pass it directly only when using [`write_wrapper`](@ref) for
a bundle built elsewhere.

behind a pointer the façade can neither build nor release, so it must

    _emit_owned_free_method(f, buffers_desc, free_lines, release_present, null_fields, zero_fields)

Emit the `.free()` method for an `:owned` carrier class. Ownership is a type
parameter, so the struct carries no ownership field; idempotence rides on the
carrier's own pointer fields, which `free()` nulls after releasing them.
Borrowed classes get no `free()` at all.

The guard has to live in the struct's bytes rather than on the Python object:
an owning carrier is usually reached as `result.value`, and every read of a
`ctypes` struct field builds a *fresh* wrapper over the same buffer, so an
attribute set on one wrapper is gone by the next read and a `_freed` flag
would never trip. Field writes reach the shared buffer and do persist.

Without release entrypoints the body raises a `RuntimeError`; the façade never
reaches it, since an owning return is demoted to a mechanical re-export in
that case (see [`_facade_classify_return`](@ref)), but a `_lowlevel` caller
gets a clear diagnosis instead of an `AttributeError`.

The guard reads a null pointer as "already freed", so every owning carrier
must allocate a non-null buffer even for an empty payload: `JLWInterop`'s
constructors call `Libc.malloc(max(n, 1) * sizeof(T))` for exactly that
reason. A `malloc(0)` there would return NULL on some platforms and turn
`free()` into a silent no-op that leaks.

`buffers_desc` fills in "buffer" or "buffers" in the docstring; `free_lines`
are the release-call statements (already indented to 8 spaces) emitted only
when `release_present`. `null_fields` names the pointer (or dimension-tuple)
fields to reset — the first doubles as the guard, and as the field every
accessor's [`_emit_freed_guard`](@ref) tests — and `zero_fields` the integer
counts.

Emit the two-line guard that opens every accessor on an `:owned` carrier

this guard an accessor run afterwards reads a null pointer with a zero count
and returns an empty result — an empty numpy array over address 0, an empty
list, an empty dict, an empty string — which the caller cannot tell from a
genuine answer. The guard turns that into a `RuntimeError` naming the class.

`ptr_field` must be the field `free()` nulls first, the same one it guards on.
Borrowed classes get no guard: nothing nulls their pointer, so it could only
fire on a carrier the caller zeroed by hand, and "already been freed" would
misname what happened to a class that has no `free()`.

    _facade_classify_arg(arg, typeinfo, typedict; pass_opaque = false) -> NamedTuple

Classify a method argument for façade auto-wrapping. With `pass_opaque`, an
argument outside the emitter's vocabulary — a raw pointer, or a struct a
library registered with `JLWInterop.carrier_type` — classifies `:primitive`
and crosses the façade as it stands, instead of classifying `:opaque`. Only
an `@api` entrypoint sets it; see [`_facade_plan`](@ref). A struct that
matched a carrier recognizer's shape but carries an unsupported payload is
excluded from that pass-through and stays `:opaque`
([`_unsupported_payload_reason`](@ref)). The return is one of:
- `(kind=:primitive,)` — pass-through
- `(kind=:carray, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CArray`; wrap with
  `<class>.from_numpy(name)`
- `(kind=:cstring, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CString`; wrap with
  `<class>.from_str(name)`
- `(kind=:cstrarray, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CStrArray`; wrap with
  `<class>.from_list(name)`
- `(kind=:cdict, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CDict`; wrap with
  `<class>.from_dict(name)`
- `(kind=:copt, classname=…)` — wrap with `<class>.from_optional(name)`
- `(kind=:opaque_arg, classname=…)` — a `COpaque` handle; pass the wrapping
  `Opaque` (or a raw address) back with `<class>(ptr=Opaque._ptr_of(name))`.
  Returned only when `release_present`, so the `Opaque` helper exists.
- `(kind=:opaque, reason=…)` — bail out; emit mechanical re-export instead.

"""
    _classify_return_type(type_id, typeinfo, typedict, release_present; method=nothing, pass_opaque=false) -> NamedTuple

Classify a return *type*, identified by its `typeinfo` id, for façade
auto-wrapping. `method` is the entrypoint whose return type this is, or
`nothing` when there is none, as in the recursive `JLWResult` call below.
`release_present` is [`_release_symbols_present`](@ref)'s verdict for the
surrounding library. `pass_opaque` is as in [`_facade_classify_arg`](@ref): a
raw pointer or unrecognized struct return then classifies `:passthrough`,
except for a shape-matched carrier with an unsupported payload
([`_unsupported_payload_reason`](@ref)), which stays `:opaque`. The
return is one of:
- `(kind=:passthrough,)` — primitive scalar (including `Cvoid`)
- `(kind=:jlwresult_unwrap, inner=<NamedTuple>)` — a [`JLWInterop.JLWResult`](@ref)
  return, recognized via [`jlwresult_struct_info`](@ref). This must be checked
  before every other struct branch below, including the embedded-`JLWStatus`
  `:opaque` branch, because `JLWResult` also has a `status` field. `inner` is
  this same classification applied to the wrapped value's type; that kind
  decides the conversion and the free, rooted at `_r.value` instead of
  `_result` (see [`_emit_facade_return_body`](@ref)/[`_emit_value_unwrap`](@ref)).
  An `:opaque` payload makes the whole return `:opaque`.
- `(kind=:carray_view, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CArray` return: the
  storage belongs to the caller, so `return _result.as_numpy()` hands back a
  zero-copy view and nothing is freed. Not gated on `release_present` — there
  is nothing to release.
- `(kind=:carray_unwrap, classname=…)` — an owning `CArray` return: inside a
  `try`, copy into a fresh numpy array (`np.array(_result.as_numpy(),
  copy=True)`) FIRST — never hand back a view over memory about to be freed
  — then a `finally` calls `_result.free()`.
- `(kind=:cstring_convert, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CString` return:
  `return _result.as_str()`. `as_str` copies, so the result outlives the
  buffer; nothing is released. Not gated on `release_present`.
- `(kind=:cstring_unwrap, classname=…)` — an owning `CString` return: inside a
  `try`, `_out = _result.as_str()` (a real copy, independent of the buffer);
  a `finally` then calls `_result.free()`, releasing `data` via `jlw_free`.
- `(kind=:cstrarray_convert, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CStrArray` return:
  `return _result.as_list()`. `as_list` copies, so the result outlives the
  buffer; nothing is released. Not gated on `release_present`.
- `(kind=:cstrarray_unwrap, classname=…)` — an owning `CStrArray` return:
  inside a `try`, `_out = _result.as_list()` (a real copy, independent of the
  buffer); a `finally` then calls `_result.free()`, releasing `data` via
  `jlw_free_strings`.
- `(kind=:cdict_convert, classname=…)` — a borrowed `CDict` return:
  `return _result.as_dict()`, no release.
- `(kind=:cdict_unwrap, classname=…)` — an owning `CDict` return: inside a
  `try`, `_out = _result.as_dict()`; a `finally` then calls `_result.free()`,
  releasing `keys` via `jlw_free_strings` AND `values` via `jlw_free` (two
  separate allocations).
- `(kind=:copt_unwrap, classname=…)` — return `_result.as_optional()`; COpt
  is by-value, so no free is involved (not gated on `release_present`)
- `(kind=:opaque_wrap,)` — a `COpaque` handle return
  ([`is_copaque_struct`](@ref)): wrap the pointer in an `Opaque`, which frees
  the Julia object with `jlw_free_opaque` on `free()` or garbage collection.
  Gated on `release_present`, like the owning carriers (`jlw_free_opaque` is one
  of the release entrypoints); otherwise the return falls through to the
  raw-pointer handling (a passthrough under `pass_opaque`).
- `(kind=:ctuple_unwrap, elements=…, accessors=…, classname=…)` — a `CNTuple`
  return, recognized via [`ctuple_struct_info`](@ref): a Python tuple built by
  converting each element by its own kind, then releasing the owning ones in
  a `finally`. `elements` is this same classification applied to each element
  type, in tuple order, and `accessors` the attribute path reaching each one.
  An element that is `:opaque`, or whose kind has no tuple-element conversion
  (a nested tuple, say), makes the whole return `:opaque`.
- `(kind=:jlwstatus_discard,)` — direct `JLWStatus` return; discard, return `None`
- `(kind=:opaque, reason=…)` — bail out. Also returned in place of
  `:carray_unwrap`/`:cstring_unwrap`/`:cstrarray_unwrap`/`:cdict_unwrap` when
  `release_present` is `false`: auto-wrapping an owning return with no release
  entrypoints available would emit a call to a symbol that does not exist.
