"""Garbage-collection smoke test for the generated `opaque_gc_py` package.

`make_model` returns an `Opaque` handle that owns a Julia object; the object
is released — exactly once — when the handle is collected or `free()`d. This
test watches `num_active_opaques()`, the count of rooted handles, to confirm
that Python garbage collection actually reaches back into Julia and frees the
object.

Run against a package importable on `sys.path` (no pytest dependency):

    python JuliaLibWrapping/examples/opaque_gc/test/smoke.py

Exits nonzero (via AssertionError) on any failure.
